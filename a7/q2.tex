\section{Question 2}

a)

Let's first prove that $b_j + b_{j+1} > 1$. Since the algorithm is online, suppose that we are at the point where bin
$j$ is still open and we have not created bin $j + 1$ yet. Suppose that an item $s_k$ comes such that it cannot fit in bin
$j$. This means that bin $j$ should be closed with a total amount of $b_j$ (total sum of items in bin $j$). Now, the
only way such that $s_k$ could not fit into bin $j$ is if $s_k > 1 - b_j$ (more than the remaining space is necessary).
We must put $s_k$ into bin $j + 1$ instead. Now, we have $b_{j + 1} \geq s_k > 1 - b_j$. Adding $b_j$ to this
inequality, we have $b_j + b_{j + 1} > 1 - b_j + b_j > 1$. Thus, our initial claim is proven.

Now, let's suppose we have $m$ bins after the last item is inserted. Suppose $m$ is even. Now, if we were to sum over
all $b_i$, we realize that $b_i + b_{i + 1} > 1$ for all $i \in \{1, 3, 5, m-1\}$ by the above proof. By grouping
subsequent bins into $\dfrac{m}{2}$ pairs, where the sum of each pair is more than 1, we establish that $b_1 + b_2 +
\ldots + b_{m-1} + b_{m} > 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1 > \dfrac{m}{2} > \dfrac{m-1}{2}$. Suppose that $m$ is odd instead. If this
were the case, then we can once again establish that $b_1 + \ldots + b_m > \sum_{i \in \{1, 3, m-2\}} b_i + b_{i + 1} >
\dfrac{m-1}{2}$ by ignoring the value of last bin $b_{m}$ and grouping the even number of $m-1$ bins into subsequent
pairs, which yields $\dfrac{m-1}{2}$ pairs, whose sums are more than 1 (each pair). These two cases tell us that $b_1 +
b_2 + \ldots + b_m > \dfrac{m-1}{2}$.

Observe that $\sum b_j \leq OPT$ as the sum of all items/bin values represents an ``ideal'' packing scenario in which
there is no fragmentation, so the number of bins required in this best case scenario ($OPT$) is at least $\lceil \sum
b_j \rceil$. In all other cases where there is fragmentation, the optimal solution must still be better than $\lceil
\sum b_j \rceil$ as this is the theoretical minimum for storing the total value of items. Thus $OPT \geq \lceil \sum b_j
\rceil \geq \sum b_j$. (This result was also stated in class.) Since $\dfrac{m-1}{2} < \sum b_j \leq OPT$, we have
$\dfrac{m-1}{2} < OPT$, and so $m < 2OPT + 1$. Thus, the algorithm uses at most $2OPT + 1$ bins.
